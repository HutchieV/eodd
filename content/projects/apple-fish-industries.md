Apple Fish Industries used Godot to produce a prototype for "OverWhole" - a Sci-Fi RPG game, which included movement, combat, story and triple-A voice acting. They also employed Google Docs, Itch.io and GitHub to collaborate and host the project.

The project is available here, on GitHub: https://github.com/SleepyWombat-32/Preiwired-Sprint-3/ https://sleepywombat.itch.io/apple-fish-industries 

It is also available to download and play here, on itch.io: https://sleepywombat.itch.io/apple-fish-industries
