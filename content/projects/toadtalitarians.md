The Toadtalitarians collaboratively produced a background story for their game, which justified the players, objectives and rules. They produced a variety of artistic assets such as 3D models and images using Blender and MagicaVoxel, and began programming the 3D game world using Godot.

The group also employed Trello has a kanban board for planning their tasks and Google Docs for collaborating on non-technical issues.

Below are some interior screenshots of the 3D spaceship Arlen produced using MagicaVoxel:
