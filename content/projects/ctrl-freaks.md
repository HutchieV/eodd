The Ctrl Freaks developed a 2D Sci-Fi, rhythm-based game which responded differently depending on the beat an action is taken on.

They employed many tools and technologies to create this game, including Godot, Trello and Piskel.

The project is available here, on GitHub: https://github.com/ThatOtherAndrew/BeatShift/

Below are some assets the team created...

...an animation cycling through different planets created in Piskel:

...and the game's boot-up screen, designed to emulate a BIOS diagnostic print out:
