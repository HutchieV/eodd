Group the Boop implemented a Discord chatbot that connects to a Discord server and can chat with users. The chatbot can answer factual questions by accessing a Wolfram|Alpha API. If the user's input cannot be treated in this way, the bot will respond using keyword matching and prepared responses. The bot was demo-ed on the #bot-testing channel on the Prewired Discord server.

The code was developed with Python (including the discord.py library) and the Wolfram|Alpha API.

The team used replit.com for code sharing, execution and testing. One team member used their own Discord server for initial deployment of the bot.

The screenshot below shows one of our mentors, Rosalyn, interacting with the bot and asking it some tricky questions:
