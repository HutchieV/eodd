The team implemented a Discord chatbot that connects to a Discord server and can chat with users. The chatbot can answer factual questions by accessing a Wolfram|Alpha API. If the user's input cannot be treated in this way, the bot will respond using keyword matching and prepared responses. The bot was demo-ed on the #bot-testing channel on the Prewired Discord server.

The code was developed with Python (including the discord.py library) and the Wolfram|Alpha API.

The team used replit.com for code sharing, execution and testing. One team member used their own Discord server for initial deployment of the bot.
